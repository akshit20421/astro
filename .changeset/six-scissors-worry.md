Adds a new `markdown.shikiConfig.transformers` config option. You can use this option to transform the Shikiji hast (AST format of the generated HTML) to customize the final HTML. Also updates Shikiji to the latest stable version.

See [Shikiji's documentation](https://shikiji.netlify.app/guide/transformers) for more details about creating your own custom transformers, and [a list of common transformers](https://shikiji.netlify.app/packages/transformers) you can add directly to your project.
