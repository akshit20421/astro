Adds telemetry for when apps are toggled in the dev toolbar. This data is completely anonymous and only the names of built-in apps are shared with us. This data will help us monitor how much the dev toolbar is used and which apps are used more. For more information on how Astro collects telemetry, visit the following page: https://astro.build/telemetry/
